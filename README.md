# Pro1-Counter-_Tiva-c-board_G25
In this project we will  implement a counter system. The counter system main components are: 1. Tiva C board 2. 3 seven-segment displays (count from 000 to 999) 3. 3 push buttons (increment by 1, decrement by 1, reset to 000) 4. Battery to power all components 5. Power switch (on/off) to enable/disable power of the entire system including Tiva C The concept of this system can be used in many applications. For example, it can be used to count number of people in queue if we replace the increment and decrement push buttons with two photo interrupters and based on the number of people in the queue estimate the waiting time for a new person who is going to stand in the queue.
